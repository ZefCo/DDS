Setup:

use density = 0.5

init the lattice with E = 0

Let it evolve for 15000 MCS to get to Equilibrium

Save configuration for the runs


Now:

turn on E field, let it run for another 15000

Take measurements of urrent and correlation function
    Avergae over 25000 MCS each run

    Quote data by averaging those across 6 runs

    -- Current:
        count jumps in the + direction and jumps in the - direction during a time interval

    -- Exchanges per bond per unit time
