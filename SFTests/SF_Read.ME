What am I even doing?

I am supposed to use

G(2)(k) = 1/N * <|s(k)**2|>

How do I get that?

s(k) is the Fourier transform of the spins.

So I have to take the entire lattice and FFT it? Like an image?

This actually makes less sense the more I think about it...

I take the FFT of the lattice at various times each sweep. Then I take that FFT to find G(t)
